# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves dockerizing a KAPLAY + Colyseus multiplayer air hockey game and deploying it on Akash Network. The project consists of a client application (Vite/TypeScript frontend) and a server application (Node.js/Colyseus backend). The goal is to create a production-ready deployment that can be accessed publicly through Akash Network's decentralized cloud infrastructure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to containerize both the client and server applications, so that they can run consistently across different environments and be deployed on Akash Network.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server application is containerized THEN it SHALL include all necessary dependencies and expose the correct port for Colyseus connections
2. WHEN the client application is containerized THEN it SHALL be built as static files and served through a web server
3. WHEN both containers are built THEN they SHALL be optimized for production with minimal image sizes
4. WHEN the containers are run THEN they SHALL communicate properly with each other through defined network configurations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure the applications for Akash Network deployment, so that they can be accessed publicly and handle multiplayer connections properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server is deployed on Akash THEN it SHALL be accessible through a public endpoint for WebSocket connections
2. WHEN the client is deployed on Akash THEN it SHALL be configured to connect to the server's public endpoint
3. WHEN environment variables are configured THEN they SHALL support both development and production modes
4. WHEN the deployment is active THEN it SHALL handle CORS properly for cross-origin requests

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create Akash deployment manifests, so that the application can be deployed on the decentralized cloud network with proper resource allocation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Akash deployment manifest is created THEN it SHALL define appropriate CPU, memory, and storage resources for both services
2. WHEN the manifest includes networking configuration THEN it SHALL expose the correct ports for HTTP and WebSocket traffic
3. WHEN the deployment is submitted to Akash THEN it SHALL include proper service definitions for both client and server
4. WHEN the services are deployed THEN they SHALL be accessible through Akash's ingress system

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access the multiplayer game through a public URL, so that I can play with friends without needing local setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the deployment is complete THEN the client SHALL be accessible through a public HTTP URL
2. WHEN players connect to the game THEN the WebSocket connections SHALL work properly through the public endpoint
3. WHEN multiple players join THEN the game SHALL handle real-time multiplayer interactions correctly
4. WHEN the game is running THEN it SHALL maintain stable connections and game state synchronization

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to have proper monitoring and logging capabilities, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor the application performance on Akash Network.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the containers are running THEN they SHALL output structured logs for debugging purposes
2. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with sufficient detail for troubleshooting
3. WHEN the deployment is active THEN health checks SHALL be available to monitor service status
4. WHEN scaling is needed THEN the deployment configuration SHALL support horizontal scaling of server instances
